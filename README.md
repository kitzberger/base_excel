#### For developers
In case TYPO3 does not run in composer mode, the library directory can be rebuilt by 
- running `composer run-script extension-create-libs`. 
- See chapter contributors.

#### For contributors
- To build the TER package, you must delete the file *Libraries/phpoffice-phpspreadsheet.phar*
  and run the command `composer run-script extension-release` in the extension folder for generating the archive.
- At the beginning you will get the question: 
    *"No composer.json in current directory, do you want to use the one at /var/www/html/typo3conf/ext/base_excel? [Y,n]?"*. 
-- Here you must answer with **N**. 
- Then everything will be downloaded and the resulting file 
*Library/phpoffice-phpspreadsheet.phar* will be generated.
